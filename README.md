# Gesture_recognition
The AI Hand Gesture Recognition System uses real-time computer vision to detect gestures like thumbs up, open palm, and fist. It integrates with GitHub to automate commits when a thumb is raised. Built with Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe, this project enables touchless control and interaction for applications like smart home automation.
